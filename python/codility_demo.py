# This is a demo task.

# Write a function:

# def solution(A)

# that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

# For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

# Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

# Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

# you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
# print("this is a debug message")

def solution(input):
    # options: sort & find first missing - n^2log(n)
    # set of size n, pop - 2n
    ints = set(input)
    for i in range(1, len(input) + 2):
        if i not in ints:
            return i
    # return 1
